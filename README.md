# Facial Keypoint Detection

- Used image processing techniques and deep learning techniques to detect faces in an image and find facial keypoints, such as the position of the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face.
- This project involves image processing and feature extraction techniques that allow one to programmatically represent different facial features. 
- Demonstrated knowledge of deep learning techniques to program a convolutional neural network to recognize facial keypoints. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition.
